The Institute of Genealogy and Heraldry played a significant role in the creation of this coat of arms, which embodies the characteristics of many generations of the Sundyrtsev family.

The motto "Deus, Diginitas, Constantia" 
was coined by one of our ancestors and represents the values of  _God, Honor, Permanence_.
